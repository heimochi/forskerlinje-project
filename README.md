This project explores how machine learning can be used to personalize treatment for patients with complex anxiety disorders. By analyzing routinely collected clinical data from Modum Bad (2016â€“2024), we aim to predict which treatmentâ€”**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** or **Metacognitive Therapy (MCT)**â€”offers the greatest benefit for each patient.

## Objective

- Apply the **Personalized Advantage Index (PAI)** to estimate individual treatment response.
- Investigate whether routinely collected baseline measures can be used to inform optimal treatment selection.
- Examine how clinical complexity influences treatment benefit and assignment.

## Data

The dataset consists of real-world clinical data from Modum Bad Psychiatric Centre, including psychometric assessments taken pre- and post-treatment.

## Methods

- Feature selection using tree-based models (e.g., `mobForest`)
- Outcome prediction via cross-validated regression and PAI
- Evaluation using clinical and statistical metrics (e.g., BAI, Reliable Change Index)

## Project Timeline

- **Analysis:** Summer 2025  
- **Manuscript:** Winter 2025  
- **Submission:** Winter 2025
